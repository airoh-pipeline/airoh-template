After `invoke fetch` is complete, expect the following content:
 * `YNIMG_BrainParcellation_summary.tsv` - a spreadsheet with some data on a series of articles.

📝 Note: tsv files are **ignored by Git** (see `.gitignore`), so data assets won't be tracked by default.

💡 If you need to track large or versioned assets, consider using [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) instead.
