# 📁 Output Data Contents

Once the pipeline is run, this folder will contain the following:

- `simulation_output.csv` — simulated data table with random values.
- `scatter.png` — a plot of the simulated data.
- `authors.csv` — a list of authors from papers found in a spreadsheet retrieved from figshare.

📝 Note: csv and png files in this folder are **ignored by Git** (see `.gitignore`), so outputs won't be tracked by default.

💡 If you need to track large or versioned outputs, consider using [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) instead.
