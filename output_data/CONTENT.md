# 📁 Output Data Contents

Once the pipeline is run, this folder will contain the following:

- `simulation_output.csv` — simulated data table with random values.

📝 Note: This folder is **ignored by Git** (`.gitignore`), so outputs won't be tracked by default.

💡 If you need to track large or versioned outputs, consider using [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) instead.
